# The-Fractal-Factory
Fall '24 15-112 Term Project

There are two main modes for this program: freeplay (titled 'Research and Development') and a quiz-like gamemode
(titled 'Production'), where the user must replicate a randomly generated
fractal. Freeplay allows a user to build their own visually-pleasing, 
self-similar geometric shapes by adjusting a handful of provided parameters. 
These parameters are controlled by various buttons, a slider, and a knob, all 
part of a dashboard on various edges of the screen. The user's fractal is drawn 
in real time in the center of the screen, making it a truly interactive 
experience. Production mode uses very similar principles to those of RnD.
Here, a 'target' fractal is shown to the user, dependent on the difficulty
selected, and the user must recreate this fractal using their allotted tools.

Running this Project:
If the .zip file has been properly extracted, simply running 'main.py' will run
the entire program. No outside modules were used, and all background image
filepaths are relative.

As stated on the 'More Info' screen within the project and in main.py, 
this project was heavily inspired by the website "Nico's Fractal Machine",
made by Nico Disseldorp.
